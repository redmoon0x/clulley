   - Make sure no other app is using port 5180
   - Try killing existing processes:
     ```bash
     # Find processes using port 5180
     lsof -i :5180
     # Kill them (replace [PID] with the process ID)
     kill [PID]

### Troubleshooting

If you see errors:
1. Delete the `node_modules` folder
2. Delete `package-lock.json`
3. Run `npm install` again
4. Try running the app again using Method 1

## Advanced Features

For details on all stealth features, see [STEALTH_FEATURES.md](./STEALTH_FEATURES.md).

## Frameless Window Design

The application uses a completely frameless, transparent window design:
- No window chrome or standard OS controls
- Variable opacity based on interaction state
- Not visible in taskbar/dock or application switchers
- Content-aware sizing that minimizes screen real estate

See [SYSTEM_DESIGN.md](./SYSTEM_DESIGN.md) for technical implementation details.
